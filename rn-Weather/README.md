# Week 5 - Homework - **Weather üå¶Ô∏è‚õÖ‚òÄÔ∏è**

## Introduction üåü

Let's build a weather app üì± using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) & [Expo](https://expo.io/). Our app will help users determine what to wear üï∂üåÇüß• in their city üèô and other cities around the world üåé!

![pwd](./intro.gif)

### Features üéØü•áüèÜ

- [ ] User is prompted to give permission for our app to use their location if they haven't already given us permission.
- [ ] User can see a locations fahrenheit & celsius temperature, description, & windspeed.
- [ ] User can see an appropriate icon depending on the weather conditions.
- [ ] User can see a background appropriate for the type of weather in their current location.
- [ ] User can see an icon appropriate for the type of their weather in a location.
- [ ] User can see buttons which allow them to see weather of different cities.
- [ ] User can see a randomly generated image of that city.
- [ ] User can see their current locations weather again with a "Current Location" button.

### Learning Objectives ‚úçÔ∏èüìöüìù

1. Learn how to [fetch()](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data) data from an API.

   - Recognize data fetching **takes time**.
   - `fetch()` - Used to make requests to API.
     - The **1st** argument is the [api endpoint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2122604/what-is-an-endpoint) we're fetching data from.
   - `json()` - Used to **parse to JS** object.

2. Learn what `async` & `await` are used for. [Read more detailed async & await](https://alligator.io/js/async-functions/).

   - Recognize they're used to make asynchronous.
     - `async` - Tells JS that a function is **asynchronous**.
     - `await` - Tells JS that this line will **take a few moments**.

3. Learn what `try` & `catch` are used for.

   - Recognize they're when we need to be careful because our code may fail.
     An example is an api request. There are other [use cases](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_try_catch.asp).

> **Tip** üí°: The permissions module of Expo is buggy. You may need to do this exercise on a device using the [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en) clients.

### **Milestone 1 üõ£üèÉ Set up app, styling, & some default city data**

**A)** Use `expo init` command to create a new project. I'm calling mine `rn-weather`.

![pwd](https://i.imgur.com/3WIdQYX.png)

**B)** Add styles to `App.js`.

Replace the boiler plate styles with something custom.

```jsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  bg: {
    flex: 1,
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
    backgroundColor: "black"
  },
  container: {
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center"
  },
  weatherContainer: {
    padding: 20,
    width: "90%",
    borderWidth: 1,
    maxWidth: "90%",
    minHeight: "20%",
    marginTop: "70%",
    borderRadius: 25,
    marginBottom: "2%",
    borderColor: "white",
    backgroundColor: "rgba(0,0,0,0.4)"
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 20,
    color: "white",
    marginLeft: 10,
    fontWeight: "bold"
  },
  row: {
    alignItems: "center",
    flexDirection: "row",
    justifyContent: "center"
  },
  cityContainer: {
    flex: 1,
    flexWrap: "wrap",
    flexDirection: "row",
    justifyContent: "space-around"
  },
  cityName: {
    fontSize: 12,
    color: "white",
    fontWeight: "bold",
    textAlign: "center"
  },
  cityButton: {
    margin: 3,
    height: 40,
    padding: 3,
    width: "25%",
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderRadius: 10,
    borderColor: "white",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
    backgroundColor: "rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"
  },
  tempRow: {
    alignSelf: "center",
    flexDirection: "row"
  },
  locationText: {
    fontSize: 25,
    color: "white",
    marginLeft: 10,
    fontWeight: "bold",
    textDecorationLine: "underline"
  },
  loading: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center"
  },
  currentLocation: {
    margin: 3,
    height: 40,
    padding: 3,
    width: "72.5%",
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderRadius: 10,
    borderColor: "white",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
    backgroundColor: "rgba(20,33,61,0.6)"
  }
});
```

**C)** Create a new folder in the root of your project `./utils`

**D)** Create a file in this folder called `index.js`.

**E)** Copy the content [this file](https://gist.github.com/PrimeTimeTran/04d9c56d0898288d04406261a556041b) into the `./utils/index.js` file we just created.

This file will contain some utility functions & data for our components to use.

### **Milestone 2 üõ£üèÉ Let's work on getting some data and having that data effect our App's state**

**A)** Import `useState` & `useEffect` from React.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
```

**B)** Import two new modules from expo we havent used yet.

```jsx
import * as Location from "expo-location";
import * as Permissions from "expo-permissions";
```

**C)** Set default `loading` state in `App`'s body.

```jsx
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
```

We want to get the user's current location immediately when the app loads so we'll set the initial value to `true`.

**D)** Define the `useEffect` method of `App` with a function call `getLocationAsync()` in it's body. The second argument means we want this effect to run once.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  getLocationAsync();
}, []);
```

**E)** Define the asynchronous function `getLocationAsync` we called in our useEffect. The reason this function is asynchronous is because we don't know how long it'll take for the user to press the `Allow` button. This `getLocationAsync` will check the `LOCATION` permission the user has granted us and call another function, `getWeather`, if allowed.

```jsx
getLocationAsync = async () => {
  const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.LOCATION);
  if (status !== "granted") {
    return;
  }

  const location = await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync();
  getWeather(location.coords.latitude, location.coords.longitude);
};
```

> **Tip** üí°: It's ok to hardcode the current location in our `getWeather` request in order to use the simulator if you can't press the `Allow` button due to a bug.

```jsx
getWeather(10.817141, 106.707954);
```

#### We should now see a prompt when the app loads

![pwd](https://i.imgur.com/qhgDrWP.gif)

**F)** Define the function `getWeather` we call in the body of `getLocationAsync`.

```jsx
getWeather = async (latitude, longitude, imgUrl = "") => {
  setLoading(true);
  const API_KEY = "3de6162d3745365b168ade2bbe4e1d66";
  const api = `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=${latitude}&lon=${longitude}&appid=${API_KEY}`;

  try {
    const response = await fetch(api);
    const jsonData = await response.json();
    setLocation({ ...jsonData, imgUrl });
  } catch (error) {
    setError(true);
  }
  setLoading(false);
};
```

This function, `getWeather`, takes three arguments. It calls the [Open Weather Api](https://openweathermap.org/appid) using [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

#### You may need to sign up for a new API key to use it

We pass it two default arguments `latitude` & `longitude`. There is a `3rd` optional argument `imgUrl` we'll use shortly.

There's a lot going on here so let's take it one line at a time.

1. We set our apps state to loading.
2. We then define an `API_KEY` to request data.
3. We use the key and the arguments `latitude` & `longitude` to define a request url.
4. We wrap the following lines of code in a `try` & `catch`. If the code inside of the `try` fails, the code within the `catch`'s body will execute.
5. We `await` and `fetch` the data.
6. We Parse the response to `json`.
7. We then [spread](https://codeburst.io/a-simple-guide-to-destructuring-and-es6-spread-operator-e02212af5831) the response object's data into a new object that includes `imgUrl`. This object is set as a `location` piece of state.
8. Lastly, we `setLoading` to `false`.

**F)** Add a new piece of state `location` and it's setter method, `setLocation` in `App`'s body.

We give it a `initial value` of a relatively complicated `object` because this is the exact data we expect to receive from the API.

```jsx
const [location, setLocation] = useState({
  name: "",
  main: { temp: "" },
  wind: { speed: "" },
  weather: [{ main: "", description: "" }]
});
```

**G)** Add a console.log above the return to check what `location` is.

![pwd](https://i.imgur.com/zWhYeub.gif)

#### We should now see that when the app loads we successfully fetch some data, _excellent_

In conjunction, if we purposefully fail the request, we see that the catch executes.

### **Milestone 3 üõ£üèÉ Display Weather Data**

**A)** Define a `WeatherCard` component above our `App` component which will render the data about the weather.

- This component determine `temperatureC` & `temperatureF` based on the prop `location` given to it.
- It will capitalizie the `description` of the weather description in the `location` prop.
- It will show a `Loading` component if the `loading` prop given to it is true.
- It will render an appropriate icon based on the weather conditions of the `location`.

<details>

<summary>Weather Card Component</summary>

```jsx
const WeatherCard = ({ location, error, loading }) => {
  const temperatureC = (location.main.temp - 273.15).toFixed(2);
  const temperatureF = (((location.main.temp - 273.15) * 9) / 5 + 32).toFixed(
    2
  );
  const description = location.weather[0].description;
  const windSpeed = location.wind.speed;
  const icon = location.weather[0].main;

  const capitalizedDescription =
    description && description.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + description.slice(1);

  if (error) {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text>Error fetching weather!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.weatherContainer}>
        {loading && <Loading />}
        <View style={styles.row}>
          <MaterialIcons name="location-city" size={25} color="lightgrey" />
          <Text style={styles.locationText}>{location.name}</Text>
        </View>
        <View style={[styles.row, { marginTop: 10 }]}>
          <MaterialCommunityIcons
            size={25}
            color="lightgrey"
            name="speedometer"
          />
          <Text style={styles.text}>{windSpeed}</Text>
        </View>
        <View style={styles.row}>
          <MaterialCommunityIcons
            size={25}
            color="lightgrey"
            name={getWeatherIcon(icon)}
          />
          <Text style={styles.text}>{capitalizedDescription}</Text>
        </View>

        <View style={styles.tempRow}>
          <View style={styles.row}>
            <MaterialCommunityIcons
              size={25}
              color="lightgrey"
              name="temperature-fahrenheit"
            />
            <Text style={styles.text}>{temperatureF}</Text>
          </View>
          <View style={styles.row}>
            <MaterialCommunityIcons
              size={25}
              color="lightgrey"
              name="temperature-celsius"
            />
            <Text style={styles.text}>{temperatureC}</Text>
          </View>
        </View>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};
```

</details>

**B)** Update imports to grab additional components we need in `WeatherCard`. We need the `MaterialIcons`, `MaterialCommunityIcons` & `ActivityIndicator`.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { ActivityIndicator, StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";
import { MaterialIcons, MaterialCommunityIcons } from "@expo/vector-icons";
```

**C)** Import some dependencies from the `utils` folder we created earlier.

```jsx
import { CITIES, getWeatherBackgroundImage, getWeatherIcon } from "./utils";
```

**D)** Define two new functions to export from the `./utils/index.js` file, `getWeatherBackgroundImage` & `getWeatherIcon`.

- `getWeatherBackgroundImage()` will choose an appropriate background based on the location's weather summary.
- `getWeatherIcon()` will choose an appropriate icon based on the location's weather summary.

```jsx
export const getWeatherBackgroundImage = description => {
  switch (description) {
    case "Thunderstorm":
      return "https://s4827.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Great-Thunderstorm-In-City.jpg";
    case "Drizzle":
      return "https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2967431.jpg";
    case "Rain":
      return "http://mybestphonewallpapers.com/download/blue-rain-6651.jpg";
    case "Snow":
      return "http://www.123mobilewallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/snow_way_wallpaper.jpg";
    case "Atmosphere":
      return "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fe/a4/13/fea4139613ef14a56a13eef545284a58.jpg";
    case "Clouds":
      return "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1513002749550-c59d786b8e6c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&w=1000&q=80";
    case "Clear":
      return "http://www.hdiphone6pluswallpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/Sky/Sky%20iPhone%206%20Plus%20Wallpaper%2037.jpg";
    default:
      return "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/49/43/da/4943da7fd8edd6af16500b2d957dbc9a.jpg";
  }
};

export const getWeatherIcon = description => {
  switch (description) {
    case "Clear":
      return "weather-sunny";
    case "Clouds":
      return "weather-cloudy";
    case "Drizzle":
    case "shower drizzle":
      return "weather-rainy";
    case "Rain":
      return "weather-pouring";
    case "Thunderstorm":
      return "weather-lightning";
    case "Snow":
      return "weather-snowy";
    default:
      return "vanish";
  }
};
```

**E)** Define the `Loading` component above our `WeatherCard` component which is used init.

```jsx
const Loading = () => (
  <View style={styles.loading}>
    <ActivityIndicator />
  </View>
);
```

**F)** Render the `WeatherCard` component in the return of `App`. Pass it the props it expects.

```jsx
<View style={styles.bg}>
  <WeatherCard error={error} loading={loading} location={location} />
</View>
```

> **Key Points** üîëüìù

- `fetch` is used to request data from an api among [other things](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data).
- Async functions begin with a `async` and have an `await` on lines which take a few moments.

- When code can fail, it's useful to have a `try` & `catch` handle the failure.

---

### **Milestone 3 üõ£üèÉ Add current & city location selection**

Our app isn't that interesting with one location, let's add a few more that a user can choose to select.

**A)** Define a new component, `CitySelectionButtons`, which will map over our `CITIES` data and render a button for each city.

```jsx
const CitySelectionButtons = props => (
  <View style={styles.cityContainer}>
    <TouchableOpacity
      key="currentLocation"
      style={styles.currentLocation}
      onPress={() => props.onChooseCity("")}
    >
      <Text style={styles.cityName}>Current Location</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
    {CITIES.map(city => {
      return (
        <TouchableOpacity
          key={city.name}
          style={styles.cityButton}
          onPress={() => props.onChooseCity(city.name)}
        >
          <Text style={styles.cityName}>{city.name}</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      );
    })}
  </View>
);
```

**B)** Define a new function in the body of `App`, `onChooseCity`, which will handle fetching data for a location.

```jsx
onChooseCity = name => {
  let randImg = "";
  if (name !== "") {
    const city = CITIES.find(city => city.name === name);
    randImg = city.imgUrl[Math.floor(Math.random() * city.imgUrl.length)];
    getWeather(city.latitude, city.longitude, randImg);
  } else {
    getLocationAsync();
  }
};
```

**C)** Define a new constant above the return of `App`, `bgImage`, which will handle selecting an appropriate background based on the user's choice.

```jsx
<ImageBackground source={bgImage} style={styles.bg}>
  <WeatherCard location={location} error={error} loading={loading} />
  <CitySelectionButtons onChooseCity={onChooseCity} />
</ImageBackground>
```

**D)** Import two new components, `ImageBackground` & `TouchableOpacity`, from React Native.

```jsx
import { ImageBackground, TouchableOpacity } from "react-native";
```

**E)** Refactor our `App` component's return to use the `ImageBackground`, `WeatherCard`, & `CitySelectionButtons` components. Pass them their appropriate props.

#### We should now be able to see all the behavior we were planning on implementing, _amazing_

## Review üíªü§ìü§î

- Defining a large component to a few smaller components to handle some of the logic in our app makes our code easier to read and understand.
- Hardcoding data for demonstration doesn't make us bad developers.

### Accomplishments ü•áüèÜüíØ

- [x] User is prompted to give permission for our app to use their location if they haven't already given us permission.
- [x] User can see a locations fahrenheit & celsius temperature, description, & windspeed.
- [x] User can see an appropriate icon depending on the weather conditions.
- [x] User can see a background appropriate for the type of weather in their current location.
- [x] User can see an icon appropriate for the type of their weather in a location.
- [x] User can see buttons which allow them to see weather of different cities.
- [x] User can see a randomly generated image of that city.
- [x] User can see their current locations weather again with a "Current Location" button.

### Rockets üöÄ

- [ ] User will see app theme colors based on temperature of the location(blue for code, orange for warm, red for hot)
